# Contributing to User Manager

We love your input! We want to make contributing to User Manager as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Follow PSR-12 coding standards
* Use Laravel Pint for code formatting: `./vendor/bin/pint`
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Comment your code where necessary

### Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Run the full test suite: `php artisan test`
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case/motivation for the feature
- Any implementation ideas you have
